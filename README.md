# Traffic Light Detection And Color Recognition
Traffic Light Detection using Tensorflow Object Detection API and Microsoft COCO Dataset

## Introduction
Humans can easily detect and identify objects present in an image. The human visual system is fast and accurate and can perform complex tasks like identifying multiple objects and detect obstacles with little conscious thought. With the availability of large amounts of data, faster GPUs, and better algorithms, we can now easily train computers to detect and classify multiple objects within an image with high accuracy.
